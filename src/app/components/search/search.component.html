<!--It could be wrapped in a form (Reactive Form) to have better control over the values, but for this use case i considered this as sufficient solution-->
<input
  type="text"
  name="search"
  [attr.aria-label]="'search-artist' | transloco"
  [placeholder]="'search-artist' | transloco"
  (input)="onSearch($event)"
/>
